# FareWell

Marketing website for **FareWell**, a beauty & wellness studio in Nürnberg
(permanent hair removal / electrolysis, diode laser, microneedling, cavitation
and massage). Built with **Angular 20** (standalone components) with SSR /
prerendering, deployed as a static site to [farewell.salon](https://farewell.salon).

## Development server

Run `npm start` (`ng serve`) for a dev server and open `http://localhost:4200/`.
The app reloads automatically on source changes.

## Build

- `npm run build` – production build into `dist/farewell`.
- `npm run watch` – development build that rebuilds on change.

## Running unit tests

Run `npm test` (`ng test`) to execute the unit tests via
[Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Google reviews

The "Google Bewertungen" carousel is rendered from a static JSON file
(`src/assets/data/google-reviews.json`) that is bundled at build time — there is
no runtime backend or API key in the browser.

To refresh the reviews:

1. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` (gitignored) and set `GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY` to a
   key with access to the **Places API (New)**. `PLACE_ID` defaults to the
   FareWell listing.
2. Run `npm run update:google-reviews` — this fetches the latest reviews from the
   Google Places API and rewrites `src/assets/data/google-reviews.json`.
3. Run `npm run build` and deploy so the refreshed reviews ship with the site.
