        As in the entire Country, Cape Town's electricity infrastructure is failing, we refuse to accept this situation 
        without proposing socially relevant and future-oriented solutions. 
        Our Goal is to finance the construction of the first Wind Turbnes in Cape Town. 
        We do believe that wind is the most suitable 
        We plan to fincance and build enough wind turbines to give load-shedding free 
        electricity to over 1000 habitants of the townships of Cape Town. As it was introduced in 2018, 
        they were supposed to be just a temporary messure. As time went, we realise they were here to stay.
        The habitants of the townships are the ones suffering the most from Load-Shedding since they don't 
        the ressources to buy external batteries or generators like most of the well off citizens of Cape Town bought.

    <p class="explanation">
        The Windmill Project. A dream, a vision, an improvement for many. It is possible to make the world a 
        better place, might it be at a smaller scale. This is the essence of the project, the wind turbine technology 
        allows for much flexibility as smaller turbines can be implemented faster and still provide energy for a few hundred people adding some power units to the grid will not only 
        better the lives of few but also improve the resilience of the South African power grid. <br> 
        As the technology pop-ups in cape town we hope to ease the entry of renewable energy by other local investors 
        and administrations
        <a href="https://www.c40knowledgehub.org/s/article/How-to-win-support-for-local-clean-energy?language=en_US" target="_blank">(as many ecological activists explain)</a> 
        that will realise the potential it brings.

            We do not only plan to deliver the turbines and potentially let them degrade over the decades. 
            We plan to form some habitants of the township so that they understand the turbines know how 
            to fufill routine maintenance and small repairs. We want the turbines not only to be used by the habitants
            but also to empower them with the knowledge and pride that they are handling a country wide issues
            on their own and for their neighbors and relatives.

            The population of the Townships have to be taken in consideration, not only the authorities
            should be asked for the permission to cnstruct. Our project has to reflect the population 
            needs as weel as implicating them thoughout the whole process. This will allow them to reproduce
            the project in the future as they see the advantages. This is why the first Turbine will be of smaller size (15m)
            in order use as a test-phase. Once done, we should write a protocol so that such innitiatives could pop-up
            more easily thoughout the coutry.
